# Project BG3 Genesis

A Python-based, lightweight, extensible character creation engine designed for experimenting with new Baldur’s Gate 3 builds before starting a fresh run.
Genesis is the beginning — a place to explore ideas, test class concepts, and understand how stats, AC, HP, and proficiencies interact at level one.
This project focuses on clarity, modularity, and faithful mechanical modeling, making it a foundation for future expansion into subclasses, leveling, equipment, and more.

## Features

- Choose a class and subclass
- Model level progression from 1–12
- View a summary of your build
- Designed as a personal learning and portfolio project

## Running the Project

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

python main.py


## Future Plans

- Add support for feats and multiclassing
- Expand class and subclass data
- Improve the user interface
- Add save/load functionality for builds

## About the Project

This project is part of my journey into software development, using a game system I love as a way to practice Python, data modeling, and iterative design.
